An online doctor appointment booking system built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL is a web-based platform designed to streamline scheduling medical consultations. Here are 2-3 key points explaining it:
Frontend and User Interface: HTML and CSS create a responsive, visually appealing layout where patients can view doctor availability, select time slots, and input details, ensuring an intuitive and accessible experience across devices.

Backend Functionality with PHP: PHP handles the server-side logic, managing user requests, processing form submissions (e.g., booking requests), and facilitating secure communication between the frontend and the database for real-time updates.

Database Management with MySQL: MySQL stores critical data like doctor schedules, patient information, and appointment records, enabling efficient retrieval and management while ensuring data integrity and security
